This week I (AK.Y'3m?YB) did some research (Do]nD0%ZXp) on wrath like (G^R9#XA7~j) I said I (A_8/b6La8d) would and I've (D=@VO\X*$+) got some fresh (Em2C$3='fn) verses to serve (Fd5LG-Y2'K) up.
"Everyone should be (AEH3cXkl8D) quick to listen, (DWknVX@J,k) slow to speak (E-9$GQhL%+) and slow to (9#*O5\%2=l) become angry, because (B^I3[+Wrl3) human anger does (B>Rhl4E#&') not produce the (F`lRE3a6's) righteousness that God (E<"mI=bNl7) desires." (James 1:19-20 NIV)
This one is (AYb-HGbZTT) pretty similar to (CJH^VoJZ"I) last week's on (D*f@+i"Ha5) staying humble, but (F,XpI0XqWp) this verse goes (F2Yng8Xds&) a bit more (E06*LmnoaG) in depth on (B~E<_#t!g^) the impact of (D+'+AoY:gq) anger on God, (E=MsU]O<`8) and how God (C@NPa:m&O9) wants us to (DV[-=p0ZsB) act.
We should represent (BP^hEt>Jl2) God, be righteous (9@9%GUR~aC) and maintain self-control (C#6-Mg!]3=) and especially patience, (G_gEjAg^DY) for choosing a (DN2dN.4ra]) path of anger (E#RtYz>^2Z) and wrath effectively (C94ETsAfU9) tarnishes God's image (Ckk/'QAKjN) of man.
"Do not take (FgKJ]ZF)#A) revenge, my dear (FqI&n_jNnC) friends, but leave (C2OdPG/_Fb) room for God's (DoF^LrC>AA) wrath, for it (BW'9~7$YVC) is written: 'It (Eq7Mi:Ce.M) is mine to (9\!W4N#ThQ) avenge; I will (EGZRE1Ljk3) repay,' says the (D6aIPb*smJ) Lord." (Romans 12:19 NIV)
This verse speaks (C"Ul6d5u2g) of revenge and (Ct/et1"U~X) payback, and how (DIlCbbKG3]) we should leave (Fh<cp3]3Hj) it up to (C~rOKQHC5) God, for the (E?y8H2i@cK) wrath of God (F/4V[+6CuU) is the ultimate (AaZ.)3Uk\+f) justice.
We put our (Fw`MCZ^I7o) hand on the (Di&;cMH(Z`) bible to swear (FD-)ON~@6#S) under oath in (EC]XeZ4H)L) court as our (ACW:KRe[Ah) politicians do when (Erdu4tCe) they are sworn (EZP)44lgakm) into office, and, (Fw`PYN7gS>) especially in court, (FY.)OUt0ZX8) it is because (CT(m@pCh~5) God will bring (Dj4zQ_W='3) justice to wrongdoers, (EIV'!WZYtK) and in this (DJET4H%W#;) case, those who (ED_8U,pAFk) are dishonest under (F6q=KlQn8t) oath.
I'm sure there (FiQb*Z@hL5) are other reasons (F~1uM<c:t?) but if God (A0d;`3LuNs) is the ultimate (CWd~9:m<R@) judge, it only (AKDe$D/@#V) makes sense that (ASbck>2cmP) we swear by (C2~2fD+/xU) His justice.
All we need (F(r1=,U^j+) to do is (CPs9j@bhmo) have faith in (Fa*_A>akFB) God that His (C(\a@%id~Y) wrath can repay (Fni?1~n) us for any (A-5#=CHWi&) misfortune, and pray (CC?Nq.LX:e) for more good (B"H83v@R:D) fortune from the (C.<9W>`bE7) Lord.
When we lose (EiN[?aPUlt) our patience and (A!S5VU-~mV) our humility, we (EQY'o;UCq=) let our own (FBPqRmcUbo) wrath bring others (Bikc+GY~FT) down unjustly, God's (D/ZddEnkNT) wrath acts in (CFT<NR_[o^) justice but our (A+WB<oN<OY) wrath is only (E$1cRM2JK3) anger and hatred.
God keeps us (F(f@c$@B:1) humble, God keeps (CIaQXj@D08) us patient, and (EtYi0{Q4[') so we pray (G9Ul=eHogB) to God to (CCk!HjG_tu) continue to grace (Ef\m%.x@Fb) us with these (F3u2L].ZCj) qualities and more.
Sorry for another (Abe9!RP9[9) late verse but (Dwfh>Y\N[S) I really wanted (AMnFt:VG$E) to hit this (CSuJ.FT!/) subject because I (EQRCk9*TXY) think most people (C6/)22EUMZ) can relate to (B0AOI24@Op) some of these (F1Af9s=`~g) issues and this (Bmf.7aU!bt) may help us (D]RGAyKCVb) recognize our wrongdoings (CJUBmOgm0r) and seek repentance.
As always, Amen, (ErhLj=]trh) and God bless (G9XZSjQX9R) your soul.
