Hey friends happy (Dc(Hp}d0r9) Easter, it's a (F7AOPCgMAU) great time to (F>8]E`*YOg) reflect on Jesus (DUd>@S*^8+) and his sacrifices (DY%0:Y)N(>) once more.
"He is not (D!R/<+"@m*) here; he has (D7U0nfs1eK) risen! Remember how (EDzK&+)qqX") he told you, (F-tgkHlnCs) while he was (E>$n;SDmna) still with you (FQ97H+jY5V) in Galilee: ‘The (DZmE%LzQmB) Son of Man (F8^8P$<yKX) must be delivered (CknE*kZgtm) over to the (CDsFqR+jm4) hands of sinners, (FA7Zr*.S6k) be crucified and (ETX_/:yoHF) on the third (FEpq{KT*2&) day be raised (E`4PT1e:N1) again.’" (Luke (CRSt{4I7{d) 24:6-7 NIV)
There's a good (ENewmjK73B) chance you've seen (EUUAKkLC!n) the 'he has (C%4Ena1QdL) risen' part of (D8+3Bo!:Gl) this verse on (Dnhj"3OdHZ) Easter today or (F_f1^<Fs) in the past, (DCHn%Ifn<o) and it's for (DljNe#3h5&) good reason.
This verse is (ETTCjQMy.s) simply the announcement (F1WTo`:qC0) of Jesus coming (FTZ/SvE0`^) back to life, (CVZ}pJm3m<) and a representation (Er1]]jP#G2) of new life, (D5It!+]LYZ) and especially God's (Fq&6Sc"tkm) final say.
Here, Jesus defeats (FME$;VJ[69) death and proves (FW+H7KjK#[) those that doubted (F&6c$Ds_l2) wrong, also showing (Ev&%jYdnEB) those stuck in (DOWp2^"k+E) a dark place (E2sJD5Wq+V) can always find (DDfpjAXb#M) new life.
Generally, this is (DNH"tNz`v7) a great reminder (ENI)$6V<%M) to anyone that (Djoq`u[<&7) personal rebirth and (Dc^ZL$XepI) second chances for (DP%y0{D^AB) yourself are always (EFjV:oB'B+) an option, it's (F)'=m'vZo1) never too late (EYSSVG9WzW) to make a (D2XKc@)wn1Z) change.
Easter is truly (FNAr;53"rz) about making that (DQnJ88OTLg) daily change to (FOqa0p>#"o) go through life (DY]r?QaaCN) as a new (DH;`NraQhp) person, for us, (Db6%z`e9Y5) we can always (D:K-$O]U35) be better, and (FRS5W0~}2!) for anyone struggling, (D1ppW_oIRh) there is always (F{K9/5^)Ai) more life to (FL9;*9rrE>) be had.
I would strongly (EbPHtk-JfP) recommend taking a (D<!mV+Q?{m) moment to consider (E)[u}TYU:e) the wisdom of (DGB^4^TrES) Easter, and always (F4h)EBzDC"5) striving for that (G&A[AG"oWi) new life.
As always, Amen, (ErhLj=]trh) and God bless (G9XZSjQX9R) your soul.
