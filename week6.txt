Hey friends happy Easter, it's a great time to reflect on Jesus and his sacrifices once more.
"He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: ‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’" (Luke 24:6-7 NIV)
There's a good chance you've seen the 'he has risen' part of this verse on Easter today or in the past, and it's for good reason.
This verse is simply the announcement of Jesus coming back to life, and a representation of new life, and especially God's final say.
Here, Jesus defeats death and proves those that doubted wrong, also showing those stuck in a dark place can always find new life.
Generally, this is a great reminder to anyone that personal rebirth and second chances for yourself are always an option, it's never too late to make a change.
Easter is truly about making that daily change to go through life as a new person, for us, we can always be better, and for anyone struggling, there is always more life to be had.
I would strongly recommend taking a moment to consider the wisdom of Easter, and always striving for that new life.
As always, Amen, and God bless your soul.
