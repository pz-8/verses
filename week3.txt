Good evening, sorry (AoDTs@r%T) this verse is (E,co4A-L^r) a bit late (E`K^MSu) I totally forgot (F\cghbjeFF) to write my (AM#`tO*G8n) analysis today haha. (D,uSmjY@)
Anyway, it's time (8A/G?ejQ>) for verse two (E@*@R13(W) of my sin-related (BLZJ>5K7LQ) verse collection, and (D\GS}V8O0Q) this week the (A`l#sE=~3i) topic is Pride, (G%[gU<jTqI) a danger to (DaFc=$'S_4) relationships and especially (8r<XCuScLq) your relationship with (A:dR3Ril0h) God.
"Pride goes before (D+EVn+#"RZ) destruction, a haughty (B)fI\\\^W) spirit before a (CcKrhXE"e>) fall." (Proverbs 16:18)
Now this verse (CM3vK/#8Be) is pretty easy (9Ak@<M=Z5V) to understand at (B7e0iCdNQ`) face value but (DE9bH*dh`5) I will say (CcKrhXE"e>) that I didn't (CqEXM`n-ED) know the definition (D@kSY*Cm`f) of 'haughty' the (EHKltElKNZ) first time I (FXl!F3'1%]) read this, so (D4ZjXZ@AhY) I looked it (BmK=:I*oIp) up and it (A3UOZqI4Z6) means "arrogantly superior (Dnt\"G]8n_") and disdainful".
I just wanted (Epo1V:9#[W) to include that (D:;*J:_HT!) bit because it (CN8n@4/pgR) helped me understand (EoUmr]5N'0) the verse a (BPQ*Zfq5iq) lot better, sometimes (F$Y,XSd@o8) I'll be reading (AoL0BO&Co() and I think (BHOo-1rWi>) I know the (EnF+A,)=h) meaning of a (CGNAqKq9Op) word but in (7)>t2ZjG."l) this case I (A%=ZN&dcdA) really didn't.
So in short, (FZ7XP1Z@+3) pride is almost (Ar(\!Lg2lC) the calm before (CHB;8$3^Fs) the storm, but (DMY;#@Y`pJ) in this case (BDg(>*) the calm causes (9S#4:_l#M8) the storm. Perhaps (FAo&37fVd") pride should instead (AsEQA@=XLu) be interpreted as (D5@eJYEc(p) the straw that (E^h*t6`/uS) breaks the camel's (A+#oj]bEEk) back.
A person who (CL]5O++MHn) is prideful, a (CVljLk#u$R) person that elevates (DAc'@QA0l9) themself above others (9:LMN(*<0U) will always find (Dq>_9gqL%t) loss and pride (A04ZKbPILW) will be their (B+jIA) downfall.
Pride makes it (9]t$0DLq.p) harder for a (8Xpp) message to go (D^UOuVmzQ&) through to someone, (FeYjK07r<) it blinds them (FzF_4mS(VE) and makes them (F'7EGfpQjW) deaf to good (C^aB+M3!np) wisdom and advice.
A very obvious (D^)e=a$FZ>) example of pride (G9Ui0S3xY>) in the Bible (7R:/n1DJ) is the fall (Ev?$j>U7mN) of Lucifer from (ALAdZ*NgRk) an exalted angel (B5^qV@R9t&) of Heaven to (9tIk`9b;'-) denouncement and damnation (F(qEj;dTkj) to Hell.
"You said in (EbgYd=_MZJ) your heart, 'I (BWkdU8Y$CN) will ascend to (AR5;DT6%v2) the heavens; I (CDQ`L3d*k>) will raise my (9LD\efaaK/) throne above the (CHTuJUF:B=) stars of God; (Fhmli!@sFj) I will sit (Ft?`pImY+0) enthroned on the (FGB6&Uu#28) mount of assembly, (F1Cm&n;:gY) on the utmost (F3Uu,`^j\g) heights of Mount (DnQPO(*a*s) Zaphon.'" (Isaiah 14:13)
In this verse (8gH6v1sQXs) regarding the fall (FZiR:C^ZDC) of Lucifer, it (AS@kE#mN1V) is said that (AF0Mu>XnWq) Lucifer wished to (AR9aO\jdh&) surpass God and (BV:IbT\h5b) perhaps take his (EDDCvbr%o`) throne. This verse (E>rI7G25k7) is the worst (E[DdL_>M'R) possible way to (FWv`PTcQX>) commit the Sin (EV4s*3B^!9) of Pride.
Believing yourself to (DsLM/P) be greater than (FCs@-?ffWl) God is the (Cb!2`qfDRR) main idea of (Ek3KL>V.VX) pride, while it (C:1KWj~GLV) is also believing (Dq>O5J"u.D) yourself to be (CYbgXb) greater than others, (G'_5qB<!mJ) being greater than (D]RgIk%S:T) God is the (AG.#]G'JlM) most prideful you (DfS(tWj+1D) can be.
Lucifer was this (9#'A.p5a^/) prideful and he (C5RDNsfM`g) ends up in (D!Wrb`$VXK) Hell, the Bible (B9V1v-HQ#o) clearly shows that (DgGMO4li2C) pride was his (Af;Yq1>rXB) downfall, as only (G>8:GK\2H4) a couple sentences (EX?&0KM3A$) after that last (D7O+?]K9RK) verse, Lucifer is (D<X4;A>/jO) said to be, (D]CWtN~9Ea) "brought down to (D4XIXT-*2Z) the realm of (FaL#K)tL+g) the dead, to (FW:Yk~>"(A) the depths of (A*F&9D>u`n) the pit." (Isaiah 14:15)
So I think (D.c]N3KPCQ) overall, these verses (G9XZSjQX9R) show exactly why (Eg^<.4EPDQ) pride is sin (CwCmLzK=49) and how deadly (EDOq1@1c^r) it can be, (F/h*k9RB0D) and that staying (ETfI(8PP&7) humble and wise (Ei:bdIB9:F) are very important (FJ6M2HkK0P) to maintaining a (Eb9m0eP0Hd) strong relationship with (EL[F-f>5&J) God.
I think an (DjCcE`b":L) interesting thought I (DhMP:/MP"g) might dig deeper (DX4L*+pJ#K) on alone is (F'M,VuZB(Y) if maintaining your (E8C8p%F]Z1) humility can be (EKCeLJgZE/) something to be (DZYy!Ue."7) prideful of if (Fae+43J@?D) you're not careful, (Eu!&?gZ@0d) if that makes (EnqT/@WMP5) any sense.
As always, Amen, (ErhLj=]trh) and God bless (G9XZSjQX9R) your soul.
