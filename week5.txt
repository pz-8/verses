Ooh, this one's (Da6u_:@;*p) a little late, (F**@WmR`+X) I'm human, had (D6bdt.y*@+) a busy day.
Anyhow let's get (F1dT<5(q+T) into a virtue (E5xbl0[a7R) themed verse on (E'2)E;`sKq) mercy.
"Blessed are the (CTjZg_&`Jm) merciful, for they (AYMH6b+KxH) will be shown (Dshhz1+%T]) mercy." (Matthew 5:7 NIV)
This one's pretty (D9Db(`rCVc) straight forward, literally (D.!)I!P"<El) saying that those (DZ:8X8hV1J) that are merciful (DA!E;o5`LV) will be blessed (FfP`z(kj1U) with mercy.
This is somewhat (D8CuJ4Fg9?) similar to some (A%=1Cb`{+T) previous verse analysis (FecjsBQaG6) about forgiveness, because (FPNfW0u&8p) mercy is simply (D0q]nK&O) forgiveness even if (DJ_+^U7@Z=) the wrongdoer doesn't (F*fRY:+.Zn) deserve it.
God shows mercy (EX[PIh'-J7) to us, we (CGMI:Kg4GV) don't deserve it (D-I/H-pDNM) but we can (B+kOJ6`:o4) show it as (FbCI1q*WsH) well, showing mercy (E%ZRUe:mR+) is showing God (E5kl@;ePYK) that you have (C"YAk51Z*) faith in his (CbZxI~.Y*I) action, imitation is (Gv3TxV;xZf) the best form (FZ65tAM5WA) of flattery, but (EFXE'Q$3) in this case (C[e)?A3A=G) flattery is more (FY%zjPC78V) defined as faith.
It's fairly easy (F,*_6M4FQ*) to apply mercy (DW#ZJ'IQrG) to the real (CS-#cKMPQ<) world, showing compassion (CUtu%-Tf<8) instead of seeking (ET<6PShu+K) revenge is pretty (CSVA/#7sJR) easy, and having (E\ZAsdyaXM) strength in forgiveness (DVVm+e9MkS) and grace is (D^5-dU@!k!) what mercy is (Dgg^]=fOo=) for us.
I'll probably do (AAw@-t@+y<) a second verse (C?`v~Hb'>u) tomorrow (or I (Aqdfc$[MfD) guess today) just (ESx#n.XF@b) to make up (Ff[Qf97C:t) for the fact (Fpg@&;ShBl) that my verses (Ck9l.5H=2l) have been a (C:gx_nqk!) little too late (F%SdiTW_oT) recently.
As always, Amen, (ErhLj=]trh) and God bless (G9XZSjQX9R) your soul.
