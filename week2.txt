Firstly, I'd like (AoDTs@r%T) to apologize for (E,co4A-L^r) citing my last ('%!&X"l^&q) verse incorrectly, I (G%fG*TtWbC) forgot to include (F\cghbjeFF) 'NIV' to signify (AM#`tO*G8n) the more recent (D,uSmjY@) English translation I (8A/G?ejQ>) used.
This week we (E@*@R13(W) will be analyzing (BLZJ>5K7LQ) two verses, both (D\GS}V8O0Q) with similar themes.
"Flee from sexual (E,U7EqOeJd) immorality. All other (#4BND-rC31) sins a person (A`l#sE=~3i) commits are outside (G%[gU<jTqI) the body, but (&INoWVoZ7c) whoever sins sexually (EpA0CA0) sins against their ('r4epcRDH) own body." (1 (6d>:A%g#9C) Corinthians 6:18, NIV)
This is a fairly (CZ70S<g!$H) widely known quote, (F$Nmp`8PaR) but I feel as (EtDO@=JCDb) though many people (FYLbEX`jA@) only look at (AR4Xj1-k?!) it on the surface (As1K9nU3o]) level so I (8uA5D"TV*N) figured we should (BOu9#m/B0>) dive deeper into (7fYZ8T%+6E) this.
Clearly, this verse (EDHdpYE79F) has a focus on (DaFc=$'S_4) sexual immorality and (8r<XCuScLq) lust, and emphasizing (A:dR3Ril0h) the impact lust (D+EVn+#"RZ) can have as (B)fI\\\^W) a sin, often (F]qU^HYMLp) being regarded as (CcKrhXE"e>) the 'deadliest' sin (CM3vK/#8Be) in media.
The media is (9Ak@<M=Z5V) correct here, in (B7e0iCdNQ`) my opinion, lust (DE9bH*dh`5) is the easiest (CcKrhXE"e>) way to sin, (CqEXM`n-ED) and as this (D@kSY*Cm`f) verse states, the (EHKltElKNZ) sin is against (FXl!F3'1%]) yourself, not just (D4ZjXZ@AhY) others. You corrupt (BmK=:I*oIp) yourself by succumbing (A3UOZqI4Z6) to lust.
Every moment of (Dnt\"G]8n_") lust you allow (Epo1V:9#[W) to happen to (D:;*J:_HT!) yourself is another (CN8n@4/pgR) moment away from (EoUmr]5N'0) God, and this (BPQ*Zfq5iq) verse is very (F$Y,XSd@o8) correct to call (AoL0BO&Co() for us to (BHOo-1rWi>) flee from lust, (EnF+A,)=h) as we are (CGNAqKq9Op) fleeing from the (7)>t2ZjG."l) Devil's grasp.
"But I tell (A%=ZN&dcdA) you that anyone (FZ7XP1Z@+3) who looks at (Ar(\!Lg2lC) a woman lustfully (CHB;8$3^Fs) has already committed (DMY;#@Y`pJ) adultery with her (BDg(>*) in his heart." (Matthew 5:28)
This verse shows (D+gX&Ymt$) us just how (Af*5dEGchd) easily it us (EN=rGe+@j7) to commit the (CN.F+"!$%N) sin of lust, (EMZ_>Gr]hE) simply having a (G(ZiPl?ixT) lustful thought is (FM6qWQ@Rg<) sinful and so (9S#4:_l#M8) we should tread (FAo&37fVd") carefully and must (AsEQA@=XLu) separate our lives (D5@eJYEc(p) from lust.
Personally, lust is (E^h*t6`/uS) quite the struggle, (A+#oj]bEEk) to be transparent (CL]5O++MHn) but I find (CVljLk#u$R) many things to (DAc'@QA0l9) be helpful, such (9:LMN(*<0U) as reminding myself (Dq>_9gqL%t) of my connection (A04ZKbPILW) and relationship with (B+jIA) God, and even (9]t$0DLq.p) thinking of lust (8Xpp) as sort of ('aNi%1djK) 'cheating' on God.
This may not (D^UOuVmzQ&) be very proper (FeYjK07r<) wording but I (FzF_4mS(VE) think it's a (F'7EGfpQjW) great motivator not (C^aB+M3!np) to be lustful, (D^)e=a$FZ>) because cheating is (G9Ui0S3xY>) such a terrible (7R:/n1DJ) thing to do (Ev?$j>U7mN) and would ruin (ALAdZ*NgRk) any relationship, especially (B5^qV@R9t&) one with God.
While I may (9tIk`9b;'-) have had impure (F(qEj;dTkj) moments, I believe (EbgYd=_MZJ) that now I (BWkdU8Y$CN) have really freed (AR5;DT6%v2) myself from the (CDQ`L3d*k>) shackles of lust, (9LD\efaaK/) and my heart (CHTuJUF:B=) and mind are (Fhmli!@sFj) far more pure (Ft?`pImY+0) and closer to (FGB6&Uu#28) God.
What I want (F1Cm&n;:gY) you to learn (F3Uu,`^j\g) from this the (DnQPO(*a*s) lesson of using (8gH6v1sQXs) God's strength to (FZiR:C^ZDC) overcome struggle, and (AS@kE#mN1V) especially temptation, you (AF0Mu>XnWq) may think of (AR9aO\jdh&) lust as I (BV:IbT\h5b) did or you (EDDCvbr%o`) may have your (E>rI7G25k7) own way of (E[DdL_>M'R) thinking, but it (FWv`PTcQX>) all brings us (EV4s*3B^!9) closer to God (DsLM/P) if we avoid (FCs@-?ffWl) temptation and sin.
If we are (Cb!2`qfDRR) lustful, we tarnish (Ek3KL>V.VX) the image of (C:1KWj~GLV) man, God's creation, (Dq>O5J"u.D) and we cannot (CYbgXb) let this happen (G'_5qB<!mJ) when God strengthens (D]RgIk%S:T) and protects us (AG.#]G'JlM) every day. We (DfS(tWj+1D) would be like (9#'A.p5a^/) a parasite, leeching (C5RDNsfM`g) off of something (D!Wrb`$VXK) greater than ourselves.
I hope this (B9V1v-HQ#o) is a good (DgGMO4li2C) reminder to skirt (Af;Yq1>rXB) lust and seek (G>8:GK\2H4) purity, and especially (EX?&0KM3A$) love, the antithesis (D7O+?]K9RK) to lust. Jesus (D<X4;A>/jO) teaches us to (D]CWtN~9Ea) love and so (D4XIXT-*2Z) we should, love (FaL#K)tL+g) people for who (FW:Yk~>"(A) they are, not (A*F&9D>u`n) what your lust (D.c]N3KPCQ) sees them as.
As always, Amen, (G9XZSjQX9R) and God bless (Eg^<.4EPDQ) your soul.
